# ToDO List

A simple yet useful tool, to maintain a guided work flow. The project has two routes the Work and a daily list route to choose from.

## Lessons Learned

I learned to use EJS as a templating engine, how to work with module, exporting them. Learning about scope of each ejs variable and refactoring the code were the most significant lessons.

## Tech Stack

**Client:** CSS, Bootstrap

**Server:** Node, Express, Ejs
